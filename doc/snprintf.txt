LINUX
===========================================

int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);

Return Value
-------------------------------------------
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null
byte used to end output to strings).

The functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() do not write more than size bytes (including the
terminating null byte ('\0')). If the output was truncated due to this limit, then the return
value is the number of characters (excluding the terminating null byte) which would have been
written to the final string if enough space had been available. Thus, a return value of size or
more means that the output was truncated.

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.


WINDOWS
===========================================

int snprintf(
   char *buffer,
   size_t count,
   const char *format [,
   argument] ...
);

int _snprintf(
   char *buffer,
   size_t count,
   const char *format [,
   argument] ...
);

Return Value
-------------------------------------------
Let len be the length of the formatted data string, not including the terminating null. Both len and
count are in bytes for snprintf and _snprintf, wide characters for _snwprintf.

For all functions, if len < count, len characters are stored in buffer, a null-terminator is
appended, and len is returned.

The snprintf function truncates the output when len is greater than or equal to count, by placing
a null-terminator at buffer[count-1]. The value returned is len, the number of characters that would
have been output if count was large enough. The snprintf function returns a negative value if an
encoding error occurs.

For all functions other than snprintf, if len = count, len characters are stored in buffer,
no null-terminator is appended, and len is returned. If len > count, count characters are stored in
buffer, no null-terminator is appended, and a negative value is returned.

Remarks
-------------------------------------------
The snprintf function and the _snprintf family of functions format and store count or fewer
characters in buffer. The snprintf function always stores a terminating null character, truncating
the output if necessary. The _snprintf family of functions only appends a terminating null character
if the formatted string length is strictly less than count characters.
